I am 31 years old (1989-07-20 ♋ / 🐍), and I am from Santiago de Chile 🇨🇱.
I have been programming since I had my first PC when I was 13 years old and I figured it out how to share MIDI files in an HTML site 🏴‍☠️.
I have been developing professionally 👔 for 6 years now.

Passionate software writer with a focus on experiences and shipping projects that matters.
In the path of improving the world one action at a time and the endless task of learning and searching for the mastery of my craft.

In my free time, I like sports 🚲, listening 🎶, and making music 🎸, technology 👨‍💻, writing🖋, and photography 📸.
