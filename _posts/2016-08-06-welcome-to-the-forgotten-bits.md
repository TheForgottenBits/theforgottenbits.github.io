Hello, everyone. This is the first post of The Forgotten Bits.

I'm Andr√©s Riveros, cofounder and software writer at resIT.cl[^1]. And my mission through this post is to show you the approach and some of the guidelines that I will follow in each post. Each guideline is presented in the form of a series of statements of intent.

## 1. Ideas Evolve. When is your work really finished?

Ideas are never final work. Your brain is constantly evolving and ideas change with it.

When I learn something new about certain topic, I will reference the previous post, continuing to write about the the subject, but adding new parts to the original.
To keep each post self-contained, I will give a brief introduction and a list of the previous post in the series. The post will not contain the Part X title because this tends to overwhelm people [citation needed].

Sometimes, corrections or small changes will be applied to each post. I will preserve the opinions and ideas written. Each change will be referred at the end of the post with a table of the versioning and changes made.

If the change is considerable or the whole opinion on the matter is different from a previous post, not being my current vision of the matter, I will attach new posts to the introduction of the previous post.

The idea of being able to keep digging into our work, to create value from a piece through iteration, is discussed by Malcolm Gladwell (The Tipping Point, Blink) in his podcast Revisionist History #07[^2]

## 2. Standing on the shoulder of Giants. Citation, not just an obligation, but a feature

The overused "on the shoulder of giants" phrase makes sense as we live in the information era and almost all the content out there is a remix of something else.

However, in science, it is a must to cite other authors when we rely on someone's idea to recognize the source and to allow people to go deep in that matter.

To preserve the references, I will both add a link to the authored content when needed and a copy of that content in case of not availability of the original website in the form of:

Keep tuned for new content weekly.

Cheers.
