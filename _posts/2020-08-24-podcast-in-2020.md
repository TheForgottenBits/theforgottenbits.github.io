Every year, I review the podcasts I listen to in order to keep perspective, rethink what I am getting into and project to the future with podcasting.

I have always thought that people changes in time, and it is OK to be a different person through life. If not, you get stuck at a fixed identify just for ego purposes, group acceptation or just daily basis life.

Podcasts have been a big part of my life for a couple of years. I learn from the best of each field, it is like sitting to drink a coffee several times a week with world-class performers, smart people, and mentors.

That is why I am very religious when it comes to listening to my favorite shows throughout the week.

I admit it can be sometimes overwhelming. Podcasting has exploded their offer and I must exercise the let it go to a lot of amazing shows in order to be able to keep track. Even for my favorite shows, some of them must be skipped, when I think some topic or episode, in particular, is not that compelling. Nevertheless, I try to avoid because you never know then some topic that seems not interesting can open some unthought doors or path to learn something new, change perspectives.

So, enough of an intro. This year, I introduced to my subscriptions the next podcasts:

## Michael Lewis - Against The Rules[^1]
