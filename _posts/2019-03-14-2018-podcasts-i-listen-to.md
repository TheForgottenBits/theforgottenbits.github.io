Every year, I review the podcasts I listen to, to keep perspective, rethink what I was into, and to project to the future with podcasting.

People change in time, and it's OK to be a different person in life. Otherwise, you would get stuck at a fixed identity just to hold to your ego, to pursue group acceptance or just because life happens and you don't stop to think about it.

Podcasts have been a big part of my life for several years now. I learn from the best of each field, it is like sitting to drink a coffee several times a week with world-class performers, smart people, and mentors.

That is why I am very religious when it comes to listening to my favorite shows throughout the week.

I admit it can be overwhelming at times. Podcasting has exploded its offer. I must exercise the let it go amazing shows to be able to keep track. Even for my favorite shows, some of them must be skipped when I think some topic or episode, in particular, is not that compelling. Nevertheless, I try to avoid it, because you never know when a subject that doesn't seem that interesting can open some unthought doors or new paths to something new, to change perspectives.

So, enough intro. This year, I introduced to my subscriptions the next podcasts:

## Akimbo: A Podcast from Seth Godin[^1]
